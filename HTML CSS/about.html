      <h1>Mission</h1>
      <p>&emsp;As a programmer competent in HTML/CSS, C#, and Java among others, 
      I aim to create a website that simplifies the process of learning 
      to code in various languages in a dynamic and engaging way. 
      I hope my work can showcase the possibilities of these coding languages, 
      as well as serve as a useful template for those learning to code for the first time.<p>
      <br>
      <h2>Me, Personally</h2>
      <p>&emsp;Outside of programming, I have served as an instructor and mentor 
      in a diverse array of activities. Primarily, I have volunteered 
      on the staff of the National Youth Leadership Training program 
      as a team leader, and risen through the ranks of the Boy Scouts of 
      America to attain the rank of Eagle Scout.
      These passions stem from my desire to help the community, 
      as well as trailblaze new strategies as part of a team. Additionally, 
      I have the personal goal to grow towards my best and most productive self 
      with integrity, and am committed to personal excellence in each project I pursue.
      On a more lighthearted note, in my free time, I enjoy playing video games, scrolling Reddit, 
      hiking, a good loaf of bread, and being exorted for head-scratches by my girlfriend's puffy bird.  </p>
