      <h1>Welcome to HTML!</h1>

    <p>
      HTML stands for Hypertext Markup Language, and is the foundational language of all websites!
      Since HTML is a markup language, it's not a programming language in the traditional sense. HTML's purpose
      is to organize and provide the bare-bones structure to web content. Think of it like a skeleton; a skeleton
      organizes organs into various areas of your body, and it also provides a structure for those organs to attach to
      and work from. It keeps stuff like eyes, ears, and your brain in the head; the heart, stomache, and lungs in the body;
      and toes and muscles in the foot.
    </p>
    <p>
      Although you <i>could</i> make a fully functioning website purely with HTML, just 
      like how you wouldn't consider a skeleton a complete and finished person, we don't typically see websites
      made with <i>only</i> HTML. We use other tools to build upon the structure that HTML gives us, such as CSS and JavaScript.
      However, since this tutorial is focused on giving you an introductory understanding of HTML itself, we won't be diving 
      into those other tools just yet (although keep a lookout for new programming language tutorials!).
    </p>


    <br>
    <p>
      First, let's get started with the software you'll need for this tutorial.
    </p>

    <h2>What You'll Need</h2>
    <ul id="list">
      <li id="list">A web browser</li>
      <li id="list">An IDE</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      And that's it! While the second one may sound intimidating, don't worry; once you get started working with it,
      it'll all be pretty straightforward.
    </p>
    <p>
      Let's take a look at each of these items.
    </p>

    <h3>Web Browser</h3>
    <p>
      Believe it or not, a web browser's job isn't just for surfing the web; it's used to develop websites as well!
    </p>
    <p>
      This helps unveil what a web browser truly does; a web browser receives a website's code and translates it
      into the website that you end up seeing on your screen. This is the difference between a web browser and a 
      search engine; a search engine fetches websites relevant to what you typed in the searchbar, while 
      a web browser takes the code from the website that the search engine found and puts it in a format that you 
      can see.
    </p>

    <h3>IDE</h3>
    <p>
      IDE stands for "Integrated Development Environment," which might sound scary and intimidating, but
      it's just something that can run and edit code, all bundled into one handy piece of software!
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>
      I will be using Firefox and Visual Studio Code as my web browser and IDE for this tutorial, however most web 
      developers use a combination of Google Chrome and Visual Studio Code; although any web browser 
      and HTML IDE will work just fine. <br><br>You can download Visual Studio Code <a class="link boujee-text" href="https://code.visualstudio.com/download" target="_blank">here.</a>
    </p>
    <br><br>


    <h1>Creating Your First HTML File</h1>
    <p>
      Before you open your fancy new IDE, we first need to establish a directory where we will keep our HTML files.
      A directory is just a fancy way of saying 'folder' and is just a place to store data such as text files or images.
    </p>
    <p>
      Go ahead and open File Explorer (or Finder, if you're using a Mac) and choose a place you'd like to store 
      your HTML file(s). 
    </p>
    <div class="normal-img">
      <img src="images/file-explorer1.png">
      <img src="images/file-explorer2.png">
    </div>
    <br>
    <p>
      Now remember where you put this folder, as we will need to find it later when we open up our IDE.
    </p>

    <br>
    <h2>Getting to Know Your IDE</h2>
    <p>
      Now that we've created our directory (folder), go ahead and open up Visual Studio Code. 
      You should see something like the image below. 
      <br>
      <i>(Note: if you are using a different IDE, you 
      may see something different)</i>
      <br>
      <br>
      Click on <b>Open Folder...</b>
    </p>
    <br>
    <div class="normal-img">
      <img  src="images/vs-code-welcome-page.png" alt="Visual Studio Code welcome page">
    </div>
    <br>
    <br>
    <p>
      This will open up File Explorer. Go and find the folder we just made, select it <i>(don't double click it!)</i>
      and then click the 'Select' button in the bottom right corner of the File Explorer window.
    </p>
    <br>
    <div class="normal-img">
      <img src="images/file-explorer3.png">
    </div>
    <br>
    <br>
    <p>
      It will then ask you if you trust the authors of the selected folder. Since we created the folder (and I'm assuming you
      trust yourself to not put malicious code in your own folder) go and click 'Yes, I trust the authors'.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now click on the icon marked in the image below. You will then be prompted to name the new file. <br>
      This is an important part, as how you name the file will determine the type of file it is. <br>
    </p>
    <br>
    <div class="normal-img">
      <img src="images/vs-code-new-file.png">
    </div>
    <br>
    <br>
    <p>
      Name this file "index.html". As you type '.html', the icon to the left of it should change to '<>'.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now you are ready to start writing HTML!
    </p>
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <h1>A Body of Tags</h1>
    <p>
      In our analogy, if HTML is the skeleton, its tags are the bones. Tags are the building 
      blocks of HTML, each serving a specific purpose. For instance, a <i>&lt;p&gt;</i> tag represents a 
      paragraph, while an <i>&lt;h1&gt;</i> tag is a heading. These tags work together to 
      create a cohesive structure for your web content.
    </p>
    <br>
    <div class="code-quote">
    <blockquote><pre><code>
    &lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;
    &lt;html&gt;
    &lt;head&gt;
        &lt;title&gt;My First Webpage&lt;/title&gt;
    &lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;body&gt;
        &lt;h1&gt;Welcome to My Webpage!&lt;/h1&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;This is a paragraph of text on my webpage.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/body&gt;
    &lt;/html&gt;
    </code></pre></blockquote>
    </div>
    <br>
    <br>
    <h2>Anatomy of a Webpage</h2>
    <p>
      Let's break down the HTML structure in the above example.
    </p>
    <br>
    <ul id="list">
      <li id="list"><b id="tag"><code>&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;</code></b>: This declaration tells the browser that we're using HTML5, the latest version of HTML.</li>
      <li id="list"><b id="tag"><code>&lt;html&gt;</code></b>: The root element, encapsulating the entire webpage.</li>
      <li id="list"><b id="tag"><code>&lt;head&gt;</code></b>: Contains meta-information about the document, such as the title.</li>
      <li id="list"><b id="tag"><code>&lt;title&gt;</code></b>: Sets the title displayed in the browser tab.</li>
      <li id="list"><b id="tag"><code>&lt;body&gt;</code></b>: Houses the content of your webpage.</li>
      <li id="list"><b id="tag"><code>&lt;h1&gt;</code></b> and <code>&lt;p&gt;</code>: Headings and paragraphs, examples of HTML elements.</li>
    </ul>
    <br>
    <br>
    <h2>More Than Just HTML?</h2>

    <p>Sure, you could make a simple website using only HTML, 
      but it's like having a house with just walls—functional 
      but lacking style. We enhance our websites with CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) 
      for design and JavaScript for interactivity. They're the interior decorators 
      and electricians of our digital space.</p>

    <br>
    <br>
    <h1>Congratulations!</h1>
    <p>
      You've taken your first steps into the captivating world of HTML! 
      You now understand the essential structure of a webpage, from the doctype declaration 
      to the body content. Remember, HTML is the foundation upon which the digital realm is 
      built, and your journey has just begun. As you continue to explore and experiment, 
      keep an eye out for the next chapters where we'll dive deeper into the art of crafting 
      stylish designs with CSS and adding interactivity with JavaScript. Happy coding, 
      and may your web adventures be both exciting and rewarding!
